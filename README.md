# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This repository is created as part of the ALX Frontend course.  
It focuses on setting up a Next.js project and understanding the core basics of working with pages, components, styling, and data fetching.  
The goal is to build a structured foundation that will be expanded in later tasks involving components, dynamic rendering, props, layouts, and API data handling.
